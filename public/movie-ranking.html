<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Usual Suspects</h3>

<p>A great script, awesome acting and just a great story</p>

<p>This right here, sheesh. Even if you are not someone 
who studies and practices Martial Arts, you will appreciate
the cinematography, screenplay, acting, etc., etc.

<h3>Love Jones</h3>

<p>A timeless classic of black love, a wonderful script
    with amazing performance. "I love you like a mother..."
